SSL Kill Switch 2
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2)

Blackbox tool to disable SSL certificate validation - including certificate
pinning - within iOS and OS X Apps. Second iteration of 
https://github.com/iSECPartners/ios-ssl-kill-switch .


Description
-----------

Once loaded into an iOS or OS X App, SSL Kill Switch 2 patches specific 
low-level SSL functions within the Secure Transport API in order to override, 
and disable the system's default certificate validation as well as any kind 
of custom certificate validation (such as certificate pinning).

It was successfully tested against various Apps implementing certificate
pinning including the Apple App Store. The first version of SSL Kill Switch 
was initially released at Black Hat Vegas 2012.

iOS Instructions
----------------

On iOS, SSL Kill Switch 2 can be installed as a Cydia Subtrate tweak on a 
jailbroken device.


### WARNING: THIS TWEAK WILL MAKE YOUR DEVICE INSECURE

Installing SSL Kill Switch 2 allows anyone on the same network as the device to 
easily perform man-in-the-middle attacks against *any* SSL or HTTPS connection. 
This means that it is trivial to get access to emails, websites viewed in Safari 
and any other data downloaded by any App running on the device.


### Installation

The following dependencies should be installed using Cydia:

* Debian Packager
* Cydia Substrate
* PreferenceLoader

Then, download the latest [pre-compiled package available in the release tab](https://github.com/upbit/ssl-kill-switch2/raw/package/com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2_0.10-1_iphoneos-arm.deb) of 
the SSL Kill Switch 2's GitHub page. Copy it to the device, install it and 
respring the device:

    dpkg -i <package>.deb
    killall -HUP SpringBoard

There should be a new menu in the device's Settings where you can
enable the extension. Finally, kill and restart the App you want to test.

The tweak can later be uninstalled using:

    dpkg -r com.nablac0d3.SSLKillSwitch2


### Intercepting the App Store's traffic

Lots of people have asked about how to intercept the App Store's traffic using 
SSL Kill Switch 2. I wrote down some instructions here:
http://nabla-c0d3.github.io/blog/2013/08/20/intercepting-the-app-stores-traffic-on-ios/


### Build

The build requires the Theos suite to be installed available at
http://www.iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started .

Then, within SSL Kill Switch 2's root foler, create a symlink to your theos 
installation:

    ln -s /<path_to_your_theos_folder> theos

Make sure dpkg is installed. If you have Homebrew, use:

    brew install dpkg

Then, the SSL Kill Switch 2 Debian package can be built using:

    make package


OS X Instructions
-----------------

SSL Kill Switch 2 can be used in OS X Apps as a dynamic library to be injected into processes.


### Usage

On OS X, the SSLKillSwitch library needs to be manually injected into the process where 
SSL pinning needs to be disabled. Once injected, it will automatically override and disable 
SSL validation. 

There are several ways to do this including:

* Start the process with LLDB and load SSLKillSwitch using `dlopen()`
* Using DYLD\_INSERT\_LIBRARIES to inject SSLKillSwitch and start the process


### Restricted Apps

TBD


### Build

Use the Xcode project to build SSL Kill Switch 2 for OS X. The compiled library will then be 
available in _Products/SSLKillSwitch.framework/Versions/A/SSLKillSwitch_. This is the binary 
that you need to inject in the process where you want to disable SSL pinning.
